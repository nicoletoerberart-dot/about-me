    <h2>A Little Bit About Me...</h2>
    <p>After more than 25 years in public accounting, I made the leap to pursue what had always pulled at my heart—creating art that brings warmth and meaning into the spaces we call home.</p>
    <p>Today, I design wallpaper that blends refined color palettes, timeless influences, and painterly textures to help you create interiors that feel both beautiful and personal. My work is inspired by nature, vintage textiles, and the subtle moments that make a house feel like home—morning light, layered linens, a quiet corner filled with color and memory.</p>
    <p>Every pattern you see here is created with care in my Colorado studio. Whether you’re decorating a nursery, styling a serene bedroom, or finishing a bold powder room, I hope my designs help you tell your story through the walls that surround you. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
